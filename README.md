## Overview

### 1. **Main Panel**:
   <img src="./files/Tela_inicial_img.png" style="width:1000px;"/>

<br>

   *This is where you can have a basic overview of the database and control it by adding/removing a product, searching, and ordering by filters.*

<br>

  <img src="./files/Tela_inicial (1).gif" style="width:1000px;"/>

  *This shows the functionality of the web page.*

<br> 

### 2. **Login and Registration**
  <img src="./files/Login.gif" style="width:600px;"/>
<br>

### 3. **Removing or Adding**
  <img src="./files/Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 23.29.18.png" style="width:600px;"/> 

   *In the first section, you can add the product's name and quantity. In the bottom section, it's possible to search for a product to remove it.*
  <br>

  <img src="./files/Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 23.31.41.png" style="width:600px;"/> 

  *On the right side of the screen, the available products are displayed, including their Unique Identifier (ID), Name, and Quantity. Each product has a button for removing it.*

<br>

### 4. **Advanced Search**
  <img src="./files/Pesquisa AvanÃ§ada.png" style="width:600px;"/> 

   *Unlike the normal search, the advanced search uses a unique ID assigned to each product, allowing for faster and more specific product searches.*
